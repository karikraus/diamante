    "# Diamante Poetry Generator\n",
    "### by Kari Kraus\n",
    "\n",
    "A diamante poem is a seven-line poem invented by Iris Tiedt in the 1960s. From the Italian word for “diamond,” diamante refers to the characteristic shape of the poem. The form is anchored by two topic words, which are often—but need not be—antithetical to each other; possible pairings include “Order-Chaos“, “Past-Future”, or “Archive-Ephemera.” As an example, consider the following manually composed Archive-Ephemera diamante poem: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Archive</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">vital and vulnerable</p>  \n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">collecting, safeguarding, disposing</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">records & logs, impermanence & flower-of-an-hour</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">tossing, disregarding, fleeting</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">transient and under-appreciated</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Ephemera</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first topic word always appears by itself at the beginning of a diamante poem, while the second appears by itself at the end. The second line of the poem consists of two adjectives describing the first topic, and the third line contains three participles, likewise describing the first topic. The fourth line is transitional, presenting a short phrase related to the first topic (e.g., “records & logs”) and a short phrase related to the second (“impermanence & flower-of-an-hour)”. This is generally the longest line of the poem and serves as its axis of symmetry. It is followed by a shift in focus to the second topic for the remaining lines, which mirror the structure of the first three.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given their formulaic reliance on distinct parts of speech, diamante poems lend themselves to computational generation using NLP techniques. The form, moreover, is plastic enough to accommodate artful deviation from the original rules laid down by Tiedt while still preserving the genre’s overall spirit and character.  The topic words, for example, can relate to each other in a variety of ways: one might be an antonym of another (Night-Day), a meronym of another (Cork-Wine Bottle), a hypernym of another (Music-Jazz), or hyponym of the other (Bestiary-Book); or else the two might simply be associative in some way or share a common conceptual domain (e.g., “Moon” and “Star” are both celestial objects). The transitional fourth line is also fairly open-ended, allowing for a wide range of creative approaches, with the main stipulation being what we might loosely conceive of as a caesura separating phraseology about the first topic from phraseology about the second. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Sidenote: The demo version of this generator uses adjectives and other descriptors pulled from the Project Gutenberg Poetry Corpus created by Allison Parrish. https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-poetry-corpus.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Diamante program is a simple text generator. The key ingredients of the Python program can be easily enumerated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A repetitive template or structure\n",
    "2. Data that can be used to populate the slots in the template\n",
    "3. A reliance on randomness to select items from the available data and insert them in the appropriate slots in the poem\n",
    "4. A loop structure that will continuously output new results"

    "## Due: 12 October\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebook for this assignment should contain the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your modded Diamante Poetry Generator (give it a new title!)\n",
    "One or more illustrations (review the Jupyter Notebook devoted to markdown to see how to add images)\n",
    "Artist’s Statement (750-1200 words, carefully proofread and formatted using Markdown)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment you’ll modify the Diamante Poetry Generator to create a customized version by substituting my words and descriptors with your own. In your artist's statement, you should select 2-3 stanza outputs to curate and briefly discuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "In broad strokes, your artist’s statement should offer a short narrative or account of the thought processes that led you to your overarching idea, as well as a discussion of how you attempted to realize that vision or idea, capturing any setbacks or challenges you encountered along the way, either artistically or technologically. More specifically, here are some of the questions you should entertain and address:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the intended theme or style of your piece? Are the atmospherics mysterious, meditative, comic, campy, or something else entirely? Were you inspired by any particular books, films, or other media?\n",
    "2. Did you encounter any setbacks, either artistic or technological? How did you address them?\n",
    "3. What illustrations did you choose and why?\n",
    "4. What made you select the stanzas you did for curation? What intrigued you about them?\n",
    "5. Do you feel any creative ownership over your modded version? Why or why not? Who is the author (or authors) of your modded version--you or the machine? \n",
    "6. You should also give consideration to evaluation criteria for combinatorial poetry, per our class discussion of Scott Rettberg’s chapter 2 in Electronic Literature. After observing that print poems are static while computer-generated poems are permutational, Rettberg stakes out the following position on what makes a combinatorial poem good or bad:\n",
    "\n",
    ">While the author of a poem intended for print publication is striving for a singularity – the one perfect expression of what they are trying to communicate – the author of a poetry generator is striving for multiplicity. A combinatory poetry generator uses variables to produce a factorial number of outputs. When this is the case, not all the outputs will be equally interesting as literature. But the best systems will produce outputs that are compelling literary experiences more often than not. The goal for the author of a combinatory work is not to produce the best literary expression of an idea, but the most interesting range of possibilities the literary system can produce. (Rettberg, 43).\n",
    "\n",
    "How have you attempted to “strive for multiplicity” and “the most interesting range of possibilities” that your Diamante mod is capable of?\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment will be assessed according to the following criteria (adapted from Professor Mark Sample at Davidson College):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Craft (the degree of mastery of the mode of composition or representation)\n",
    "2. Intention (the sense of intentionality and deliberateness of the work)\n",
    "3. Theme (the level of engagement with the designated theme of the mod)\n",
    "4. Argument (the degree to which your project and artist’s statement make a claim or thoughtful argument about electronic literature, authorship, combinatorial poetry, and related topics we’ve discussed in class that are relevant to the assignment)\n",
    "5. Resiliency (the degree to which you're able to resourcefully recover from failure when something in your project goes spectacularly wrong)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fostering an Atmosphere of Trust and Respect\n",
    "Since we'll often share work, I want to include additional guidelines for fostering an atmosphere of trust and respect. When formulating your ideas and pursuing projects and experiments, please heed the excellent advice offered by professor and e-lit author extraordinaire Allison Parrish:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Read Leonard Richardson’s \"Bots Should Punch Up\". \n",
    "\n",
    ">“You can poke fun at yourself (Stephen Colbert famously said ‘There’s no status I would not surrender for a joke’), you can make a joke at the expense of someone with higher social status than you, but if you mock someone with lower status, it’s not cool.” Be sensitive to what your classmates (and others) might find offensive, triggering, or violent; be graceful (not defensive) and listen carefully when your work gets called out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you can copy-and-paste code cells to create duplicates. You might want to create several cells with the \"House of Dust\" code so that if you make a mistake and get an error message, you can start with a fresh cell. Review the first notebook if you've forgotten how to add and delete cells. You can also make copies of your notebook by selecting \"Make a Copy\" from the \"File\" pulldown menu at the top of your screen. I'd encourage you to make several copies so that if you break the code, you can start with a fresh notebook."
